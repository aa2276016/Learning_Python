# You are given a set of square coordinates where we have placed white pawns.
# You should count how many pawns are safe.
# Input: Placed pawns coordinates as a set of strings.
# Output: The number of safe pawns as a integer.

# Example:
# safe_pawns({"b4", "d4", "f4", "c3", "e3", "g5", "d2"}) == 6
# safe_pawns({"b4", "c4", "d4", "e4", "f4", "g4", "e5"}) == 1
