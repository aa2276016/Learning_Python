# You are given a two or more digits number N. For this mission, you should find the smallest positive number of X, such that the product of its digits is equal to N. If X does not exist, then return 0.

# Input: A number N as an integer.
# Output: The number X as an integer.

# example:N = 20. We can factorize this number as 2*10, but 10 is not a digit. Also we can factorize it as 4*5 or 2*2*5. The smallest number for 2*2*5 is 225, for 4*5 -- 45. So we select 45.

                return False
        return True

    return 0
