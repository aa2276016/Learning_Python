# Q4: If Function vs Statement
# Let's write a function that does the same thing as an if statement.

# Despite the doctests above, this function actually does not do the same thing as an if statement in all cases. To prove this fact, write functions c, t, and f such that with_if_statement returns the number 1, but with_if_function does not (it can do anything else):

def with_if_statement():
    if c():
        return t()
    else:
        return f()  # if return f(), then t() will not be examined

def with_if_function():
    return if_function(c(), t(), f())  # all c(), t(), f() will be examined before return value

# define c(), t() and f():
def c():
    return True

def t():
    return 1

def f():
    return 1/0   # the key is whether f is called or not

# test it out
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('Q4')
    print(with_if_statement())
    # print(with_if_function())  # lead to ZeroDivisionError
    print('passed')

# The difference is not the link before c() to t() and f(), but about if python interpreter will examine the same object before output


# Q5: Hailstone
# Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-prize-winning book, GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach, poses the following mathematical puzzle.

# Pick a positive integer n as the start.
# If n is even, divide it by 2.
# If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
# Continue this process until n is 1.
# The number n will travel up and down but eventually end at 1 (at least for all numbers that have ever been tried -- nobody has ever proved that the sequence will terminate). Analogously, a hailstone travels up and down in the atmosphere before eventually landing on earth.

# This sequence of values of n is often called a Hailstone sequence, Write a function that takes a single argument with formal parameter name n, prints out the hailstone sequence starting at n, and returns the number of steps in the sequence:

def hailstone(n):
    """Print the hailstone sequence starting at n and return its length."""
    count = 1
    while n != 1:
        print(n)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
            count += 1
        else:
            n = n * 3 + 1
            count += 1
    print(n)
    return count

    print('Q5:')
    assert hailstone(10) == 7
    print('all passed')
