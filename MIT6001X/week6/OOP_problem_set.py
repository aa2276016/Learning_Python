# This assignment will deal with a well-known (though not very secure) encryption method called the Caesar cipher.
# Some vocabulary to get you started on this problem

# Encryption - the process of obscuring or encoding messages to make them unreadable until they are decrypted
# Decryption - making encrypted messages readable again by decoding them
# Cipher - algorithm for performing encryption and decryption
# Plaintext - the original message
# Ciphertext - the encrypted message.

# ps6.py - a file containing three classes that you will have to implement.
# words.txt - a file containing valid English words (should be in the same folder as your ps6.py file).
# story.txt - a file containing an encrypted message that you will have to decode (should be in the same folder as your ps6.py file).
